JJ Hynes is 42, a veteran of the Troubles in Derry and Belfast has sacrificed his life, marriage, family to the Cause. Now he’s on the run.  Traumatised, bewildered, JJ finds refuge in the Netherlands with a survivor of the Dutch Resistance who is still haunted, like himself, by memories of the past. 

Fate intervenes and JJ is called back to Ireland, tasked with persuading comrades in the West to back the ‘road to peace’, a process he wants to believe in.
In the village of Killoveragh, he encounters Ashling, a might-have-been sweetheart from his time in Dublin, and her sister Nora.

Can JJ, wavering himself, persuade the hardliners to support the process leading to peace and a political settlement?

Can there be peace, happiness and even love for somebody like him?

History, politics, and possible redemption come together here in a narrative that reads like a thriller but asks serious and important questions about the interweaving of personal and national trauma.
