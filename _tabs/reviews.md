	<p><b>Longlines</b> is a powerful encounter with recent Irish history. A thrilling novel of escape and redemption. An IRA man on the run from the past returns to Ireland to get involved in the peace process. In beautifully crafted prose, it tells the story of the Northern Troubles and the collective change of heart in which a country moves from its violent past into a place of hope and optimism. A fantastic read and a huge achievement. I loved the character envying the grass growing along with so many other wonderful observations.

JJ is a moody, solitary figure, the sort of man you want to spend time with and figure him out.

### Peter Sheridan
Peter also talked about: 
- 'Moments in there where I go 'shit, I never saw that coming...'
- 'A lot of tension here in this book that owes much to film...'
- 'On the run: Here we have a character who doesn't know anyone in the environment that he's in...'
- 'The reader identifies with the loneliness of the central character who is in a situation of jeopardy. Hitchcock understood tension; there is a lot of Hitchcockian stuff going on which serves the book very well.'
