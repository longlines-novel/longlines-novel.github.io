### Hugo Hamilton

**Longlines** is a powerful encounter with recent Irish history. A thrilling novel of escape and redemption. An IRA man on the run from the past returns to Ireland to get involved in the peace process. In beautifully crafted prose, it tells the story of the Northern Troubles and the collective change of heart in which a country moves from its violent past into a place of hope and optimism. A fantastic read and a huge achievement. I loved the character envying the grass growing along with so many other wonderful observations.

### Peter Sheridan

JJ is a moody, solitary figure, the sort of man you want to spend time with and figure him out.

_**Peter Sheridan** (Irish author, playwright, director), speaking at the Dublin launch of Longlines._

Peter also talked about: 
- "Moments in there where I go &#39;shit, I never saw that coming...&#39;"
- "A lot of tension here in this book that owes much to film..."
- "On the run: Here we have a character who doesn&#39;t know anyone in the environment that he&#39;s in..."
- "The reader identifies with the loneliness of the central character who is in a situation of jeopardy. Hitchcock understood tension; there is a lot of Hitchcockian stuff going on which serves the book very well."

### Lelia Doolan

Longline fishing is a good metaphor in a tale that catches and brings ashore many of the arguments, prejudices, beliefs and pitfalls of romantic Ireland where indeed peace comes dropping slow.

Writing is a bit like embroidery - creating the image and the tale, stretching the threads to embellish and fashion the connections - over time, over continents. Emotions, villainy, benevolence - weaving and darning together the lasting effects of actions and non-actions.

Nothing you can do can stop time&#39;s unfolding. You don&#39;t ever let go of the thread.

The thing about fiction is that there is always a person who is the thread, whose entire purpose is to draw us through the thicket of events to a pleasant or a horrible outcome. That&#39;s the beauty of the teasing and the tension. What is this journey all about? Where are we going? Who is involved? Why?

So here, Caoilte weaves and debates the knotty matter of republicanism - with a small or a big R; The Movement, with a big or a small M ~ the unending Irish dilemma with maleness and militarism and nationalism. And with colonialism and the Brits. And then, most importantly, the Northern Peace process. It&#39;s a tapestry that some of Caoilte&#39;s family have been intimately involved in over the centuries until the recent past. So, it is very good that he turned his already well-made historical and folkloric writing skills and kept going all the years it took to weave this story. Weaving takes patience and endurance!

The Everyman he&#39;s chosen to carry the thread here has a number of names:

Stevie, or Michael, but most of all, JJ. A one-time young Derry Civil Rights marcher, then volunteer in the IRA, husband and father, later a jailbird, now a father and husband departed from the North, still active and on the run, still following orders from commanding officer, Garvey, but getting older, little by little. Getting tired, too. A self-effacing somewhat nebulous lone pilgrim who&#39;s been a long time on the journey.

After an intriguing opening chapter to introduce the action and the characters who will turn up later in other scenes, we find JJ in Holland with a couple of old Resistance fighters from the Second World War, one of them still on the quest for personal reprisal.

And then, suddenly, a plan from Ireland for JJ to run guns - masquerading as bananas - back to the boys in Belfast. There&#39;s a wild and dangerous scene in a seedy Dutch hotel - as graphic and bloody as any double-cross scene in 007 Daniel Craig&#39;s mad life. The action scenes are written with riveting immediacy - especially, later, when JJ&#39;s old comrade turns up in the west, seeking payback from the onetime barrister hostage from scene one. There&#39;s a top speed encounter which goes horribly and graphically wrong..

So yes, we&#39;re in the West of Ireland where JJ is supposed to be promoting the path to peace among loyal volunteers in Clare and Galway - which he does rather lazily while avoiding any chores in the rather damp cottage and overgrown garden. Very unlike Caoilte&#39;s own husbandry!

Formally, the book is in four parts, ten chapters in all. But there are also enjoyable nudges and prompts within the narrative â€“ The Blue Note; Revelations, Importing Bananas, Boys from Home, Christened Babies. Tea with Mikey - little curlicues within the weave!

And little by little, we&#39;re moving toward the beginning of insight and a connection, at last, to the humanity of living in a community which has eluded JJ in his pain-ridden world - and a realisation of where real love and comradeship lies. Not with the younger, nubile Ashling but with [..]! In the end, all stories are love stories...

I was intrigued by the book&#39;s title - which only comes into play in the story&#39;s later life when JJ meets a grand old neighbour by the sea. It is a good metaphor in a tale that catches and brings ashore many of the arguments, prejudices, beliefs and pitfalls of romantic Ireland where indeed peace comes dropping slow.

The final scene is an action-packed denouement, splendidly achieved. Threads tied up in a scene worthy of any grand finale.

### Timothy Jones

Set in the early stages of the Northern Ireland peace process, this entertaining crime-adventure-love story offers insight into the activities and conflicted mindset of the IRA. There is self-discovery and emerging love as the protagonist finds his own inner peace process, despite himself. It reads like an inside story even though it&#39;s not an autobiography.

The author is a self-declared Irish republican and he has done his homework. That gives the book weight. It is a pleasure to recommend &#39;Longlines&#39;, whether you are Irish and open to self-recognition, or British and open to new perceptions of the Troubles, or just any person who loves a good read.

I found &#39;Longlines&#39; engrossing. I also found myself racing through it in my spare time, and now I&#39;m making time to go back over my favourite scenes. Give it some of your own time and you will be well rewarded. This is first class reading with depth, enlightenment and compassion under the fast-moving narrative.
