### Hugo Hamilton

**Longlines** is a powerful encounter with recent Irish history. A thrilling novel of escape and redemption. An IRA man on the run from the past returns to Ireland to get involved in the peace process. In beautifully crafted prose, it tells the story of the Northern Troubles and the collective change of heart in which a country moves from its violent past into a place of hope and optimism. A fantastic read and a huge achievement. I loved the character envying the grass growing along with so many other wonderful observations.

### Peter Sheridan

JJ is a moody, solitary figure, the sort of man you want to spend time with and figure him out.

**Peter Sheridan** (Irish author, playwright, director), speaking at the Dublin launch of Longlines.

Peter also talked about: 
- "Moments in there where I go &#39;shit, I never saw that coming...&#39;"
- "A lot of tension here in this book that owes much to film..."
- "On the run: Here we have a character who doesn&#39;t know anyone in the environment that he&#39;s in..."
- "The reader identifies with the loneliness of the central character who is in a situation of jeopardy. Hitchcock understood tension; there is a lot of Hitchcockian stuff going on which serves the book very well."

### Timothy Jones

Set in the early stages of the Northern Ireland peace process, this entertaining crime-adventure-love story offers insight into the activities and conflicted mindset of the IRA. There is self-discovery and emerging love as the protagonist finds his own inner peace process, despite himself. It reads like an inside story even though it&#39;s not an autobiography.

The author is a self-declared Irish republican and he has done his homework. That gives the book weight. It is a pleasure to recommend &#39;Longlines&#39;, whether you are Irish and open to self-recognition, or British and open to new perceptions of the Troubles, or just any person who loves a good read.

I found &#39;Longlines&#39; engrossing. I also found myself racing through it in my spare time, and now I&#39;m making time to go back over my favourite scenes. Give it some of your own time and you will be well rewarded. This is first class reading with depth, enlightenment and compassion under the fast-moving narrative.
