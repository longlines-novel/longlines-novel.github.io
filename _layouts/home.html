<p><i>"Memories are the key not to the past, but to the future."<br>
<b>Corrie ten Boom</i></b></p>

<p>Longlines focuses on the challenges facing militant republicans in Ireland during the peace process negotiations in the mid-1990s.

Following a failed operation, JJ Hynes, a veteran of the Troubles in Derry and Belfast, is on the run. In the Netherlands, he finds refuge with survivors of the Dutch Resistance who, like himself, are also struggling with memories of the past. Called back to Ireland, JJ is tasked with persuading comrades in the West to back the 'road to peace', a process he wants to believe in.</p>
