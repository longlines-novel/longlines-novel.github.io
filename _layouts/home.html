<p><i>JJ Hynes, a veteran of the Troubles in Derry and Belfast has sacrificed his life, marriage, family to the Cause. Now he’s on the run.<br/><br/>

Traumatised, bewildered, JJ finds refuge in Holland with a survivor of the Dutch Resistance who is still haunted, like himself, by memories of the past.<br/><br/>

Fate intervenes and JJ is called back to Ireland, tasked with persuading comrades in the West to back the ‘road to peace’, a process he wants to believe in.<br/><br/>

In the village of Killoveragh, he encounters Ashling, a might-have-been sweetheart from his time in Dublin, and her sister Nora.<br/><br/>

Can JJ, wavering himself, persuade the hardliners to support the peace process?<br/><br/>

Can there be peace, happiness and even love for somebody like him?<br/><br/>

History, politics, and possible redemption come together here in a narrative that reads like a thriller but asks serious and important questions about the interweaving of personal and national trauma.</i><br/><br/>
